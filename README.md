# Where's Waldo?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

The project is a recreation of the popular game "Where's Waldo"./
In the game the user is required to detect and pinpoint all the hidden characters in order to win and _hopefully_ get their name on the leader board.

## Technologies

The app's core technologies are React, Javascript, HTML and CSS for the frontend.\
On the backend side it features usage of Firebase's database and is also hosted on the platform.

## Key Features

The app contains a mix of Javascript functionally, React hooks & routing combined with Firebase core methods in order to interact the complexity of pinpointing hidden characters\
Another cool feature is the responsive CSS design which is achieved without any media queries!\
The app is comprised of 4 main pages to cover the game from start to finish:

- Home(Level choosing)
- Game(Shows different levels dynamically)
- Leader board
- 404

## Important Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `firebase deploy`

Deploys the build folder and starts up a live version of the app using firebase's hosting.\
